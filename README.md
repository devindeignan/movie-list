# movie-list
List of movies that you can edit.
The program asks for input in the form of numbers 1-8. Each number corresponds to a function that will edit the list of movies.
Users can add a movie, view the list, mark off a movie, remove a movie, remove all movies, sort the movies alphabetically, and view the number of movies in the list.
Shout out to my partner Alma Marshall!
